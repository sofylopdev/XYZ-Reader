# XYZ-Reader

Sixth Project for the Android Nanodegree


## Project Overview

In this project, you will redesign an app to follow the Material Design guidelines and translate a set of static design mocks to a living and breathing app.


## Why this Project?

This project gives you an opportunity to improve an app’s design, a vital skill for building apps users will love. It also replicates a common developer task of updating and changing an app's design as new standards are released.


## What Will I Learn?
Through this project, you will:

 - Understand the fundamentals of Android design.
 - Apply Material Design guidelines to an mobile application.
 - Separate an interface into surfaces.
 - Effectively use transitions and motion.


## How Will I Complete this Project?

You will improve an app for this project:

 - XYZ Reader: A mock RSS feed reader featuring banner photos and headlines. [Download the code here](https://github.com/udacity/xyz-reader-starter-code).
 
The app is currently functional, and work in most cases for most users.

Your job will be to take the user feedback in the UI Review node, and implement changes that will improve the UI and make it conform to Material Design.


## User Feedback for XYZ Reader:
*Lyla says:*
“This app is starting to shape up but it feels a bit off in quite a few places. I can't put finger on it but it feels odd.”

*Jay says:*
“Is the text supposed to be so wonky and unreadable? It is not accessible to those of us without perfect vision."

*Kagure says:*
“The color scheme is really sad and I shouldn't feel sad.”
